// Jonas and I started our code off pretty much the same, the one thing that I saw him do was pause at each step inside of his function and turn them into variables. I think that was something to consider, and something I would like to do in the future, because I feel like it would make the code a bit easier to read and make it easier on myself, because I had to find a way around not being able to return the average within my reduce method, so I had to create another variable to capture it. Just some important things to note is making each step a variable so it is not only easier for myself to read in the future but easier for others who would read my code. I think another reason why it would improve my code to make each section into a variable is because it would correspond with the instructions of the challenege making it easier to comprehend
